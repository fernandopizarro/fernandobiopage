        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Fernando Pizarro is a commercial tech leader. He is currently Chief Operating Officer at Aikito, a construction marketplace. He is the author of several books on B2B SaaS related topics.</p>
        <p>Fernando's most recent book, written with Jacco Van Der Kooij, is a look at how each of the Go To Market stages in a recurring revenue business have a different mathematical basis. That insight leads to fundamentally different prioritization of resources and a radical new approach to sales as a science. Learn more about The SaaS Sales Method.</p>
        <p>Earlier work includes a guide to enterprise startups which he wrote in collaboration with Tae Hea Nahm, a partner at Storm Ventures, and Bob Tinker, CEO of MobileIron. Find out more here: Survival to Thrival: Building the Enterprise Startup.</p>
        <p>His first book was "Blueprints for a SaaS Sales Organization," which he co-wrote with Jacco Van Der Kooij. In Blueprints Fernando delved deep into what makes a Software as a Service company sales team tick and provided pragmatic advice for executives in an industry that is changing so fast that old sales models just don't work anymore. Fernando also published "Farm Don't Hunt: The Definitive Guide to Customer Success," which examines the rise of an entirely new business function to cope with the changes brought on by the recurring revenue model in a digital world.</p>
        <p>Fernando grew up the son of diplomats and moved all around the world working for companies like Disney, Discovery, and Yahoo before coming back to the Bay Area. He has a BA from Harvard and an MBA from the University of Chicago.</p>
